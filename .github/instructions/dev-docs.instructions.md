# Development Documentation Guidelines

This directory contains development logs and internal documentation tracking development progress and decisions.

## Documentation Style

- **Development Log Format**: Documentation should follow a development log style, recording what was done in recent development activities
- **Chronological Tracking**: Track development steps and decisions as they occur
- **Internal Audience**: This is internal documentation for the development team, not end-user documentation

## Update Policy

**Critical**: When adding new development information:

- **Update Existing Documents**: For content related to an existing topic, always update the existing document rather than creating a new one
- **Consolidate Information**: Keep related development notes together in the same file
- **Create New Files Only When**: You are explicitly asked to create a new file, or the topic is genuinely distinct from existing documentation

This approach maintains a clean, organized development history without fragmenting related information across multiple files.
