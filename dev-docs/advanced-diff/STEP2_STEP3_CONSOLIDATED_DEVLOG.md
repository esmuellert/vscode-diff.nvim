## Understanding Steps 2-3: Clarification

### Critical Insight: The Calling Pipeline

After analyzing VSCode's TypeScript source code, we now have complete clarity:

**VSCode's Actual Call Chain:**
```typescript
// File: defaultLinesDiffComputer.ts
const diffs = myersDiffAlgorithm.compute(lines1, lines2);
const optimized = optimizeSequenceDiffs(lines1, lines2, diffs);
const final = removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs(lines1, lines2, optimized);
```

**VSCode's optimizeSequenceDiffs Implementation:**
```typescript
// File: heuristicSequenceOptimizations.ts
export function optimizeSequenceDiffs(seq1, seq2, diffs) {
    let result = diffs;
    
    // Internal Step A: Join by shifting (called TWICE for better results)
    result = joinSequenceDiffsByShifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    result = joinSequenceDiffsByShifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    // Internal Step B: Shift to better boundaries
    result = shiftSequenceDiffs(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    // Internal Step C: Join small gaps (nested call!)
    result = removeShortMatches(seq1, seq2, result);  // ≤2 gap threshold
    
    return result;
}
```

### The Confusion We Had

**Our Original Misunderstanding:**
- Step 2 = `optimizeSequenceDiffs` (boundary shifting only)
- Step 3 = `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs` (gap joining only)

**The Reality:**
- Step 2 = `optimizeSequenceDiffs` which **INTERNALLY** calls:
  - `joinSequenceDiffsByShifting` (twice)
  - `shiftSequenceDiffs`
  - `removeShortMatches` (≤2 gap, nested!)
- Step 3 = `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs` which:
  - Uses ≤4 non-whitespace character gap threshold
  - Requires one diff >5 lines to join
  - Iterates up to 10 times

**Why This Matters:**
- `removeShortMatches` (≤2 gap) is PART OF Step 2
- `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs` (≤4 chars) is Step 3
- These are TWO DIFFERENT functions with DIFFERENT logic
- We initially confused them as one function

---

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-10-24 AM: Initial Implementation (Deprecated)

**Approach:** Direct implementation using raw line arrays

**Problems Identified:**
- Hardcoded for line arrays only (not reusable for Step 4)
- Single-pass boundary shifting (VSCode uses two-pass)
- Gap threshold ≤3 (should be ≤2 for `removeShortMatches`)
- Not using ISequence abstraction

**Result:** Basic functionality but not production-ready

---

### 2025-10-24 PM: Complete Rewrite with ISequence

**Decision:** Completely rewrite using ISequence infrastructure for Step 4 reusability

**What We Implemented:**

#### 1. `joinSequenceDiffsByShifting()` (130 lines)
Two-pass algorithm that shifts insertion/deletion diffs to enable merging:

```c
// Pass 1: Shift left using getElement()
for (d = 1; d <= length; d++) {
    if (seq1->getElement(seq1, start-d) != seq1->getElement(seq1, end-d) ||
        seq2->getElement(seq2, start-d) != seq2->getElement(seq2, end-d)) {
        break;
    }
}
if (d == length) {
    // Can join with previous diff
    merge_with_previous();
}

// Pass 2: Shift right using isStronglyEqual()
for (d = 0; d < length; d++) {
    if (!seq1->isStronglyEqual(seq1, start+d, end+d) ||
        !seq2->isStronglyEqual(seq2, start+d, end+d)) {
        break;
    }
}
if (d == length) {
    // Can join with next diff
    merge_with_next();
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Only works on insertion/deletion diffs (one range empty)
- Uses fast hash comparison (`getElement`) in Pass 1
- Uses exact comparison (`isStronglyEqual`) in Pass 2
- Called **TWICE** by `optimizeSequenceDiffs` for better results

#### 2. `shiftSequenceDiffs()` (65 lines)
Shifts diffs to better boundary positions using boundary scores:

```c
// Calculate shift range
int delta_before = 1;
while (can_shift_left && delta_before < MAX_SHIFT_LIMIT) {
    delta_before++;
}

int delta_after = 0;
while (can_shift_right && delta_after < MAX_SHIFT_LIMIT) {
    delta_after++;
}

// Find best position by boundary score
for (int delta = -delta_before; delta <= delta_after; delta++) {
    int score = seq1->getBoundaryScore(seq1, offset1) +
                seq2->getBoundaryScore(seq2, offset2_start) +
                seq2->getBoundaryScore(seq2, offset2_end);
    if (score > best_score) {
        best_score = score;
        best_delta = delta;
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Only works on insertion/deletion diffs
- MAX_SHIFT_LIMIT = 100 (matches VSCode)
- Uses `getBoundaryScore()` for language-agnostic boundary detection
- Swaps sequences for deletion diffs

#### 3. `removeShortMatches()` (35 lines)
Simple gap-based joining (≤2 lines gap threshold):

```c
for (int i = 0; i < diffs->count; i++) {
    int gap1 = current.seq1_start - last->seq1_end;
    int gap2 = current.seq2_start - last->seq2_end;
    
    // VSCode: join if gap ≤ 2 in EITHER sequence
    if (gap1 <= 2 || gap2 <= 2) {
        // Join with last
        last->seq1_end = current.seq1_end;
        last->seq2_end = current.seq2_end;
    } else {
        result[result_count++] = current;
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Works on ALL diff types (including modifications)
- Threshold: ≤2 lines gap in EITHER sequence
- Called internally by `optimizeSequenceDiffs` (NOT separate step)

#### 4. `optimizeSequenceDiffs()` (Main Step 2 Function)
Orchestrates the three algorithms:

```c
SequenceDiffArray* optimize_sequence_diffs(
    ISequence* seq1,
    ISequence* seq2,
    SequenceDiffArray* diffs
) {
    SequenceDiffArray* result = diffs;
    
    // Call joinSequenceDiffsByShifting TWICE
    result = join_sequence_diffs_by_shifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    result = join_sequence_diffs_by_shifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    // Shift to better boundaries
    result = shift_sequence_diffs(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    // Remove short matches (≤2 gap)
    result = remove_short_matches(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    return result;
}
```

**Result:** ✅ 100% VSCode parity for Step 2

---

### 2025-10-25 AM: Step 3 Implementation

**Function:** `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs()`

**File:** `src/optimize.c` (+90 lines)

**Algorithm** (VSCode parity):
```c
// Iterate up to 10 times until no more joins
for (counter = 0; counter < 10 && should_repeat; counter++) {
    should_repeat = false;
    
    for each consecutive diff pair (before, after):
        // Get gap text between diffs
        gap_text = lines[before.seq1_end .. after.seq1_start-1]
        non_ws_count = count_non_whitespace_chars(gap_text)
        
        // Calculate diff sizes
        before_total = before.seq1_len + before.seq2_len
        after_total = after.seq1_len + after.seq2_len
        
        // Join if small gap AND at least one large diff
        if (non_ws_count <= 4 && (before_total > 5 || after_total > 5)):
            join(before, after)
            should_repeat = true
}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Accesses line text via `LineSequence* line_seq = (LineSequence*)seq1->data`
- Counts non-whitespace characters across gap lines (not just gap size!)
- Joins diffs by extending `last_result->seq1_end` and `seq2_end`
- Iterates up to 10 times (VSCode behavior)
- Returns modified array in-place

**Result:** ✅ 100% VSCode parity for Step 3

---

### 2025-10-25 PM: Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Test Philosophy Change

**Original Testing Problem:**
- Tests were validating "it runs successfully" (smoke tests)
- Not validating actual correctness of output
- Step 1, 2, 3 outputs not separately verified

**New TDD Approach:**
```
For each test case:
1. Prepare input lines_a and lines_b
2. Manually calculate expected Step 1 output (Myers)
3. Verify Step 1 produces expected output
4. Manually calculate expected Step 2 output (optimize)
5. Verify Step 2 produces expected output
6. Manually calculate expected Step 3 output (removeVeryShort)
7. Verify Step 3 produces expected output
```

**Critical Rule:** NO copying output from running code as expected results. All expectations must be manually derived using intellect.

#### Test Suite: `tests/test_line_optimization.c` (700+ lines)

Created 10 comprehensive test cases:

**Test 1: Simple Addition**
- Input: Single line insertion
- Validates: Edge case, no joining needed

**Test 2: Small Gap But Small Diffs (Should NOT Join)**
- Gap: 1 char (≤4 ✓)
- Both diffs: 2 lines total (≤5 ✗)
- Expected: NOT joined (requires one diff >5)
- Validates: Step 3's "large diff" requirement

**Test 3: Large Content Between Changes**
- Gap: 53 chars (>4 ✗)
- Expected: NOT joined (gap too large)
- Validates: Gap threshold enforcement

**Test 4: Blank Line Separators with Large Diff (Should Join)**
- Gap: 0 chars (≤4 ✓)
- First diff: 8 lines total (>5 ✓)
- Expected: **JOINED** ✓
- Validates: Core Step 3 functionality

**Test 5: Function Refactoring**
- Myers produces single continuous diff
- Validates: Already optimal case

**Test 6: Import Statement Changes**
- Myers produces single continuous diff
- Validates: Continuous change handling

**Test 7: Comment Block Modification**
- Large single diff (6 lines)
- Validates: No unnecessary joining

**Test 8: Small Gap with Large Diff (Should Join)**
- Gap: 1 char (≤4 ✓)
- First diff: 12 lines total (>5 ✓)
- Expected: **JOINED** ✓
- Validates: Step 3's primary use case

**Test 9: Mixed Insertions and Modifications**
- Myers optimally produces [2,3)→[2,4)
- Validates: Mixed diff type handling

**Test 10: Multi-Line String Change**
- Myers produces single diff
- Validates: Consecutive change handling

**Result:** ✅ 10/10 tests passing

## Implementation Details

### ISequence Abstraction

The optimization algorithms are **generic** and work on any `ISequence`:

```c
// Line-level (Steps 2-3)
ISequence* seq1 = line_sequence_create(lines_a, len_a, false);
ISequence* seq2 = line_sequence_create(lines_b, len_b, false);
optimize_sequence_diffs(seq1, seq2, diffs);
removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs(seq1, seq2, diffs);

// Character-level (Step 4) - SAME FUNCTIONS!
ISequence* char_seq1 = char_sequence_create(text_a, start, end);
ISequence* char_seq2 = char_sequence_create(text_b, start, end);
optimize_sequence_diffs(char_seq1, char_seq2, char_diffs);
```

**Benefit:** Zero code duplication between line and character optimization!

### ISequence Methods Used

| Method | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `getElement()` | Fast hash comparison | joinSequenceDiffsByShifting (Pass 1) |
| `isStronglyEqual()` | Exact comparison | joinSequenceDiffsByShifting (Pass 2), shifting |
| `getBoundaryScore()` | Boundary quality | shiftSequenceDiffs (optional) |
| `getLength()` | Sequence length | All functions (bounds checking) |

---

## Test Development Methodology

Each test followed rigorous TDD principles:

1. **Manual Analysis**: Trace Myers algorithm by hand to predict Step 1 output
2. **Verification**: Run isolated Step 1 to confirm expectations
3. **Step-by-Step Deduction**:
   - Step 2 output: Apply optimization rules manually
   - Step 3 output: Apply gap joining logic manually
4. **No Cheating**: All expectations derived intellectually, never copied from code output
5. **Validation**: Use `assert_diffs_equal()` for batch assertion

### Helper Functions (`tests/test_utils.h`)

```c
// Deep copy for independent testing
SequenceDiffArray* copy_diff_array(const SequenceDiffArray* src);

// Batch assertion for diff arrays
void assert_diffs_equal(
    const SequenceDiffArray* actual,
    const SequenceDiffArray* expected,
    const char* step_name
);
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

| Function | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `joinSequenceDiffsByShifting` | O(D × L) | L = max gap length |
| `shiftSequenceDiffs` | O(D × 100) | MAX_SHIFT_LIMIT = 100 |
| `removeShortMatches` | O(D) | Single pass |
| `removeVeryShort...` | O(D × 10) | Up to 10 iterations |
| **Total (Step 2+3)** | O(D × L) | Dominated by shifting |

**D** = number of diffs (typically small for similar files)

### Space Complexity

- O(D) for result arrays
- In-place modification after transformation
- No recursion (all iterative)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Study Implementation, Not Just Documentation

**Problem:** Initial understanding of Steps 2-3 was confused.

**Solution:** Read actual VSCode TypeScript source code line-by-line.

**Learning:** Documentation and API signatures can be misleading. Always verify against actual implementation.

### 2. Nested Function Calls Are Tricky

**Problem:** `optimizeSequenceDiffs()` internally calls `removeShortMatches()`, which is NOT the same as `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs()`.

**Solution:** Map out complete call chain with function names.

**Learning:** VSCode has similar naming for different functions with different thresholds (≤2 vs ≤4).

### 3. Test What, Not How

**Problem:** Early tests just verified "no crash" (smoke tests).

**Solution:** Calculate expected output manually for each step.

**Learning:** TDD means predicting outputs intellectually, not copying code results.

### 4. ISequence Abstraction Pays Off

**Problem:** Initial implementation was hardcoded for line arrays.

**Solution:** Rewrite using ISequence interface.

**Learning:** Same optimization code now works for both lines (Steps 2-3) and characters (Step 4). Zero duplication!

### 5. Two-Pass Shifting is Critical

**Problem:** Single-pass shifting misses merge opportunities.

**Solution:** Implement two-pass algorithm (left, then right).

**Learning:** VSCode calls `joinSequenceDiffsByShifting()` TWICE for even better results.

---

## Next Steps → Step 4: Character-Level Refinement

**Already Complete (Reusable from Steps 2-3):**
- ✅ `optimize_sequence_diffs()` - Works on CharSequence
- ✅ `remove_short_matches()` - Works on CharSequence
- ✅ Boundary scoring infrastructure

**Need to Implement for Step 4:**
1. **CharSequence** implementation (ISequence interface)
2. **Character-level Myers** (reuse existing Myers with CharSequence)
3. **removeVeryShortMatchingTextBetweenLongDiffs()** (character version of Step 3)
4. **extendDiffsToEntireWordIfAppropriate()** (word boundary extension)
5. **Translation from char offsets to (line, col) positions** → `RangeMapping[]`

**Status:** Ready to proceed with Step 4 implementation.
