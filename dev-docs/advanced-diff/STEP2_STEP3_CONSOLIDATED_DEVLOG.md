## Understanding Steps 1-2-3: The Complete Picture

### VSCode's Line-Level Diff Pipeline

After thorough analysis of VSCode's TypeScript source code, we have complete clarity on the pipeline:

**VSCode's Actual Call Chain:**
```typescript
// File: defaultLinesDiffComputer.ts (line-level)
const diffs = myersDiffAlgorithm.compute(lines1, lines2);           // Step 1
const optimized = optimizeSequenceDiffs(lines1, lines2, diffs);     // Step 2
const final = removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs(            // Step 3
    lines1, lines2, optimized
);
```

**Step 2: `optimizeSequenceDiffs` - Internal Structure:**
```typescript
// File: heuristicSequenceOptimizations.ts
export function optimizeSequenceDiffs(seq1, seq2, diffs) {
    let result = diffs;
    
    // Sub-step A: Join by shifting (called TWICE for better results)
    result = joinSequenceDiffsByShifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    result = joinSequenceDiffsByShifting(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    // Sub-step B: Shift to better boundaries  
    result = shiftSequenceDiffs(seq1, seq2, result);
    
    return result;
}
```

### Our Initial Misunderstanding vs. Reality

**What We Initially Thought:**
- Step 2 outputs boundary-shifted diffs only
- Step 2 is a standalone testable unit
- Step 3 is completely separate from Step 2

**The Reality:**
- Step 2 (`optimizeSequenceDiffs`) is a composite function that orchestrates 2 sub-algorithms
- Step 2 performs boundary shifting and joining via shifting, but **does NOT** call `removeShortMatches`
- `removeShortMatches` is a separate exported function (not part of the Step 1-2-3 pipeline for line-level)
- Step 3 (`removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs`) uses different logic (≤4 chars + size check)
- **Testing Steps 1+2+3 together** is the most effective approach

### Why Testing Steps 1+2+3 Together Makes Sense

1. **Step 2 has minimal direct visual effect** - it mostly prepares data for Step 3
2. **Step 2's main consumer is Step 4** (character-level refinement) via boundary scores
3. **Step 3 produces the actual visible line-level optimization** that users see
4. **VSCode tests them together** in their line-level diff computer
5. **Real-world test cases** naturally exercise the full pipeline

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Myers Algorithm (`myers_diff_algorithm`)

**What It Does:**
- Computes minimal edit distance using O(ND) Myers algorithm
- Returns sequence of diff blocks: `[seq1[a,b) -> seq2[c,d), ...]`

**Critical Bug Fixed (2025-10-25):**
```c
// BUG: capacity field was uninitialized in 3 places
SequenceDiffArray* result = malloc(sizeof(SequenceDiffArray));
result->count = diff_count;
// MISSING: result->capacity = diff_count;  // <-- This caused memory corruption!

// FIX: Always set capacity when allocating
result->capacity = diff_count;
```

**Impact:** Without capacity set, `copy_diff_array()` allocated 0 bytes, causing heap corruption and crashes.

### Step 2: Optimize Sequence Diffs (`optimizeSequenceDiffs`)

**Composite Function with 2 Sub-steps:**

#### 2A. `joinSequenceDiffsByShifting` (called 2x)
- **Purpose:** Merge insertion/deletion diffs by shifting boundaries
- **Algorithm:** Two-pass approach (left shift, then right shift)
- **Limitation:** Only works on pure insertions/deletions (one range empty)

#### 2B. `shiftSequenceDiffs`
- **Purpose:** Move diff boundaries to better positions (e.g., word/line boundaries)
- **Algorithm:** Evaluate boundary scores within shift limit (max 100 positions)
- **Limitation:** Only works on insertions/deletions

**Why Step 2 Is Hard to Test Directly:**
- Both sub-steps primarily benefit character-level refinement (Step 4)
- Sub-steps have limited visual effect on line-level diffs
- Most test cases either show no change or trigger Step 3 instead

### Step 3: Remove Very Short Matching Lines (`removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs`)

**Purpose:** Join diffs separated by very short matching content

**Algorithm:**
```c
// Iterate up to 10 times for convergence
for (int iteration = 0; iteration < 10; iteration++) {
    for (each pair of consecutive diffs) {
        // Get unchanged range between diffs
        OffsetRange unchangedRange = [current.seq1_end, next.seq1_start);
        
        // Count non-whitespace chars in gap
        int non_ws_chars = count_non_whitespace(seq1, unchangedRange);
        
        // Join if: gap ≤4 non-ws chars AND 
        //         (current total range >5 OR next total range >5)
        int current_total = current.seq1_len + current.seq2_len;
        int next_total = next.seq1_len + next.seq2_len;
        
        if (non_ws_chars <= 4 && (current_total > 5 || next_total > 5)) {
            merge(current, next);
            changed = true;
        }
    }
    if (!changed) break;
}
```

**Key Rules:**
1. Gap must have ≤4 non-whitespace characters (whitespace ignored)
2. At least ONE diff must have total range sum (seq1_len + seq2_len) > 5
3. Iterates until convergence (max 10 iterations)

**Why This Is the Main Line-Level Optimization:**
- Most visible effect on diff output
- Removes "noise" from small separators (blank lines, braces, etc.)
- Produces cleaner, more readable diffs for users

## Test Strategy: Test-Driven Development

### Test Structure (Systematic Approach)

Each of the 10 comprehensive tests follows this pattern:

```c
TEST(test_name) {
    // 1. SETUP: Define input sequences
    const char* lines_a[] = {...};
    const char* lines_b[] = {...};
    ISequence* seq1 = line_sequence_create(lines_a, ...);
    ISequence* seq2 = line_sequence_create(lines_b, ...);
    
    // 2. EXPECTED AFTER STEP 1 (Myers)
    SequenceDiffArray* after_step1 = create_diff_array(10);
    add_diff(after_step1, ...);  // Manually calculated
    
    SequenceDiffArray* myers = myers_diff_algorithm(seq1, seq2, 5000, &timeout);
    print_sequence_diff_array("After Step 1 (Myers)", myers);
    assert_diffs_equal(myers, after_step1);  // Verify our calculation
    
    // 3. EXPECTED AFTER STEP 2 (optimize)
    SequenceDiffArray* after_step2 = create_diff_array(10);
    add_diff(after_step2, ...);  // Manually calculated
    
    SequenceDiffArray* step2_actual = copy_diff_array(myers);
    optimize_sequence_diffs(seq1, seq2, step2_actual);
    print_sequence_diff_array("After Step 2 (optimize)", step2_actual);
    assert_diffs_equal(step2_actual, after_step2);  // Verify step 2
    
    // 4. EXPECTED AFTER STEP 3 (removeVeryShort)
    SequenceDiffArray* expected_final = create_diff_array(10);
    add_diff(expected_final, ...);  // Manually calculated
    
    SequenceDiffArray* actual_final = copy_diff_array(step2_actual);
    remove_very_short_matching_lines_between_diffs(seq1, seq2, actual_final);
    print_sequence_diff_array("After Step 3 (removeVeryShort)", actual_final);
    assert_diffs_equal(actual_final, expected_final);  // Verify step 3
    
    // 5. CLEANUP
    // Free all allocations
}
```

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Verifies each step independently** with manually calculated expectations
2. **Prevents "fake tests"** - we can't just copy function output as expected result
3. **Shows intermediate results** via `print_sequence_diff_array` for debugging
4. **Tests the full pipeline** as it's actually used in VSCode
5. **Exercises real-world scenarios** that developers encounter

### The 10 Comprehensive Test Cases

1. **Simple Addition** - Single line insertion
2. **Small Gap, Small Diffs** - Should NOT join (both ≤5 lines)
3. **Large Gap** - Should NOT join (>4 non-whitespace chars)
4. **Blank Lines with Large Diff** - Should join (gap ≤4 chars, one diff >5 lines)
5. **Function Refactoring** - Continuous change
6. **Import Changes** - Continuous modifications
7. **Comment Block** - Multi-line modification
8. **Scattered Edits with Large Diff** - Should join (large diff triggers joining)
9. **Mixed Changes** - Insertion + modification
10. **Multi-line String** - Continuous multi-line change

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-10-24: Initial Implementation

**Morning:** First iteration with line arrays
- Implemented basic `optimizeSequenceDiffs` with line arrays
- Single-pass shifting, gap threshold ≤3
- Not production-ready

**Evening:** Complete rewrite with ISequence

### 2025-10-25: Critical Fixes and Enhancement

**Morning:** Memory corruption debugging
- Discovered heap corruption when running tests
- Used valgrind to identify root cause
- Found uninitialized `capacity` field in Myers algorithm

**Fixed:** Added capacity initialization in 3 places in `myers.c`:
```c
result->capacity = 0;        // For empty case
result->capacity = 1;        // For single-diff case  
result->capacity = diff_count;  // For general case
```

**Enhanced:** Test visualization
- Added `print_sequence_diff_array()` calls after each step
- Shows intermediate results for debugging
- Proper memory management (don't free intermediate results too early)

**Result:** 
- ✅ All 21 tests passing
- ✅ Zero memory leaks
- ✅ Clean valgrind output
- ✅ Production-ready

## Test Output Example

```
=== Test 4: Blank Line Separators with Large Diff ===
  After Step 1 (Myers): 2 diff(s)
    [0] seq1[0,4) -> seq2[0,4)
    [1] seq1[6,7) -> seq2[6,7)
  Step 1 (Myers): verified
  
  After Step 2 (optimize): 2 diff(s)
    [0] seq1[0,4) -> seq2[0,4)
    [1] seq1[6,7) -> seq2[6,7)
  Step 2 (optimize): verified
  
  After Step 3 (removeVeryShort): 1 diff(s)
    [0] seq1[0,7) -> seq2[0,7)
  Step 3 (removeVeryShort): verified
  ✓ Line optimization pipeline complete
```

**Analysis:** Step 3 successfully merged the two diffs because:
- Gap between diffs: 2 blank lines = 0 non-whitespace chars (≤4 ✓)
- First diff total range: 4 + 4 = 8 (>5 ✓) — **Triggers the join condition**
- Second diff total range: 1 + 1 = 2 (≤5)
- **Result:** Join succeeds because at least one diff has total range >5

## Key Learnings

1. **Always initialize all struct fields** - Uninitialized fields cause subtle bugs
2. **Test-driven development works** - Writing expected results first catches bugs early
3. **VSCode's composite functions** - Step 2 is not a simple unit, it's a pipeline
4. **Testing the full pipeline** is more effective than testing sub-steps in isolation
5. **Memory management is critical** - Don't free intermediate results too early
6. **Visualization helps debugging** - Printing intermediate results reveals logic errors
7. **Valgrind is essential** - Memory corruption can be silent without it
