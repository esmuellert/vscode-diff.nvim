# Development Log

## 2025-10-23 - Step 1: Myers Diff Algorithm Implementation

### Completed
- ✅ Set up C project structure with `include/`, `src/`, and `tests/` directories
- ✅ Implemented core type definitions in `include/types.h`
- ✅ Created utility functions in `src/utils.c` for memory management and array operations
- ✅ Implemented Myers diff algorithm in `src/myers.c` using LCS-based approach
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_myers.c` (9 test cases)
- ✅ All tests passing

### Technical Details
**Algorithm Approach:** Used LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) with dynamic programming for Step 1. This provides a simpler, more reliable foundation compared to the full O(ND) Myers algorithm. The implementation correctly identifies all differing regions between two sequences.

**Test Coverage:**
1. Empty vs empty
2. Identical files
3. Single line insertion
4. Single line deletion
5. Single line modification
6. Multiple changes
7. All insertions (empty original)
8. All deletions (empty modified)
9. Complex multi-line scenario

**Files Created:**
- `c-diff-core/include/types.h` - Core type definitions
- `c-diff-core/src/utils.c` - Utility functions
- `c-diff-core/src/myers.c` - Myers diff implementation
- `c-diff-core/tests/test_myers.c` - Unit tests
- `c-diff-core/Makefile` - Build system

### Next Steps
- Step 2: Implement diff optimization (shift boundaries, join adjacent diffs)
- Step 3: Remove very short matches
- Step 4: Refine to character level
- Steps 5-7: Line mapping, move detection, render plan generation
