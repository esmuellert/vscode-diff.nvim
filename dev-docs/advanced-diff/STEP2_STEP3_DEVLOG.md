# Steps 2 & 3: Diff Optimization - Development Log

## Timeline

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Implementation Summary

### Step 2: optimize_sequence_diffs()
- **Purpose:** Shift boundaries to natural positions (blank lines, braces) and join adjacent diffs
- **Algorithm:** Join diffs if gap ≤ 2 lines in both sequences
- **VSCode Ref:** `diffAlgorithm.ts::optimizeSequenceDiffs()`

### Step 3: remove_short_matches()
- **Purpose:** Join diffs separated by short matching regions  
- **Algorithm:** Join if match ≤ 3 lines in both sequences
- **VSCode Ref:** `diffAlgorithm.ts::removeShortMatches()`

## Test Results

**Total: 20 tests, all passing ✓**

### Integration Test Cases

**Case 1: Step 2 Joining (gap=2)**
```
Myers:    2 diffs → [1,2) and [4,5)
Optimize: 1 diff  → [1,5)         ← Step 2 joins!
Remove:   1 diff  → [1,5)
```

**Case 2: Step 3 Joining (match=3)**
```
Myers:    2 diffs → [1,2) and [5,6)
Optimize: 2 diffs → [1,2) and [5,6)  (gap=3, no join)
Remove:   1 diff  → [1,6)            ← Step 3 joins!
```

**Case 3: No Optimization**
```
Myers:    1 diff → [1,4)  (contiguous changes)
Optimize: 1 diff → [1,4)
Remove:   1 diff → [1,4)
```

**Case 4: Large Gap (no joining)**
```
Myers:    2 diffs → [1,2) and [7,8)
Optimize: 2 diffs → [1,2) and [7,8)  (gap=5 > 2)
Remove:   2 diffs → [1,2) and [7,8)  (match=5 > 3)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Step 2:** O(D × L) - D=diffs, L=diff length
- **Step 3:** O(D) - linear scan
- **Space:** O(1) - in-place modification

### Threshold Values (VSCode Parity)
- Gap threshold: **≤ 2 lines**
- Match threshold: **≤ 3 lines**

### In-Place Modification Pattern
```c
int write_idx = 0;
for (int read_idx = 0; read_idx < count; read_idx++) {
    if (should_keep_separate) {
        arr[write_idx++] = arr[read_idx];
    } else {
        extend(arr[write_idx - 1], arr[read_idx]);
    }
}
count = write_idx;
```

## Investigation & Fix

### Problem Discovered
Original integration test used poor test case - two consecutive changed lines resulted in ONE Myers diff with no gap for optimization to demonstrate.

### Solution
Created explicit test cases showing:
- Gap-based joining (Step 2)
- Match-based joining (Step 3)
- No-join scenarios (thresholds)

### Lesson
**Test cases must exercise the algorithm.** Show clear before/after transformations, not no-ops.

## Next: Step 4

Apply Myers diff at character level within changed line ranges for precise inline highlighting.
