# Column Translation Parity Gap - Summary

## Overview

Fixed the parity gap where character-level diff offset translation to (line, column) positions was incorrect when whitespace trimming was enabled.

## Problem

When `considerWhitespaceChanges: false`, VSCode trims leading/trailing whitespace before diffing but preserves the trimming metadata to correctly map positions back to the original lines. Our C implementation was discarding this information, causing character-level diffs to map to wrong columns.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced `CharSequence` Structure

Added two fields to track whitespace trimming:
- `trimmed_ws_lengths`: Length of leading whitespace trimmed from each line  
- `original_line_start_cols`: Starting column offset in original lines

### 2. Updated `char_sequence_create()`

- Counts and stores trimmed leading whitespace during sequence construction
- Allocates and manages the new tracking arrays

### 3. Fixed `char_sequence_translate_offset()`

- When mapping offset → (line, col), adds back the trimmed whitespace
- Formula: `col = original_line_start + line_offset + trimmed_ws`
- Matches VSCode's `LinesSliceCharSequence.translateOffset()` exactly

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test file `tests/test_column_translation.c` with three test suites:

1. **Trimmed Whitespace Test**: Verifies column translation with various leading whitespace amounts
2. **No Trimming Test**: Ensures unchanged behavior when trimming is disabled
3. **Edge Cases**: Tests empty lines and whitespace-only lines

### Example

```c
Input: "    hello world    "  // 4 leading spaces
Trimmed: "hello world"
Offset 0 ('h') → Line 0, Col 4  ✅ Correctly adds back 4 spaces
```

## Parity Status

✅ **100% Parity Achieved** - Column translation now matches VSCode exactly.

## Files Modified

- `c-diff-core/include/sequence.h` - Enhanced CharSequence structure
- `c-diff-core/src/sequence.c` - Implemented trimming offset tracking
- `c-diff-core/tests/test_column_translation.c` - Comprehensive test suite (NEW)
- `c-diff-core/Makefile` - Added test-column-trans target
- `dev-docs/advanced-diff/midterm-evaluation/midterm-evaluation-en.md` - Updated parity status

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- Character-level diff ranges map to correct editor columns
- Diff highlighting appears at the right positions
- Whitespace trimming doesn't break position translation
- Full compatibility with VSCode's diff presentation

## Related Work

This completes the infrastructure-level parity gaps identified in the midterm evaluation:
- ✅ Perfect hash implementation
- ✅ Boundary scoring alignment
- ✅ Word extension handling
- ✅ Column translation with trimmed offsets (this fix)

Only algorithmic gap remaining: whitespace-only rescanning between line diffs.
