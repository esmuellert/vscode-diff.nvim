# VSCode Diff Algorithm - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to implement VSCode's advanced diff algorithm for achieving pixel-perfect parity. The implementation follows a pipeline architecture where each step transforms data through well-defined types.

## Project Structure

### Recommended C Project Layout (Flat Structure)

C projects typically use **flat source structure** for simplicity and build efficiency. This is a best practice in C development.

```
c-diff-core/
├── include/
│   └── types.h                    # All public type definitions
├── src/
│   ├── myers.c                    # Step 1: Myers diff algorithm
│   ├── optimize.c                 # Steps 2-3: Diff optimization
│   ├── refine.c                   # Step 4: Character-level refinement
│   ├── mapping.c                  # Step 5: Line range mapping construction
│   ├── moved_lines.c              # Step 6: Move detection (optional)
│   ├── render_plan.c              # Step 7: Convert to render plan (STUB FIRST)
│   ├── utils.c                    # Utility functions (string, memory, etc.)
│   └── diff_core.c                # Main orchestrator + Lua FFI entry point
├── tests/
│   ├── test_myers.c
│   ├── test_optimize.c
│   ├── test_refine.c
│   ├── test_mapping.c
│   ├── test_moved_lines.c
│   ├── test_render_plan.c
│   └── test_integration.c
├── diff_core.h                    # Public API for Lua FFI
└── Makefile                       # Build system
```

**Why Flat Structure?**
- Standard C practice: Most C projects (Linux kernel, SQLite, Git) use flat or minimal hierarchy
- Easier to navigate: All source in one place
- Simpler builds: No complex include paths
- Better for small-to-medium projects (<50 files)

**Note:** We'll use this structure for the rewrite. The current `diff_core.c` will be replaced with a clean stub implementation.

## Required Utility Functions

These utilities are needed across multiple steps. VSCode implements them in various locations:

| Utility Function | Purpose | VSCode Reference |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| `string_hash()` | Hash strings for move detection | `src/vs/base/common/hash.ts` - `hash()` |
| `array_append()` | Dynamic array growth | `src/vs/base/common/arrays.ts` - `pushMany()` |
| `line_trim()` | Trim whitespace for comparison | `src/vs/base/common/strings.ts` - `trim()` |
| `char_at_utf8()` | Safe UTF-8 character access | `src/vs/base/common/strings.ts` - `getNextCodePoint()` |
| `range_contains()` | Check if range contains position | `src/vs/editor/common/core/range.ts` - `containsPosition()` |
| `range_intersect()` | Check range intersection | `src/vs/editor/common/core/range.ts` - `intersectRanges()` |
| `line_range_contains()` | Check if line range contains line | `src/vs/editor/common/core/ranges/lineRange.ts` - `contains()` |
| `line_range_delta()` | Shift line range by offset | `src/vs/editor/common/core/ranges/lineRange.ts` - `delta()` |
| `mem_grow()` | Realloc with error checking | Common pattern in C (not in VSCode) |
| `str_dup_safe()` | Safe string duplication | Common pattern in C (not in VSCode) |

**Implementation Note:** Create `src/utils.c` to house these helpers. This keeps algorithm code clean and focused.

## Type Validation Against VSCode

### Core Types (Verified ✓)

Our `types.h` accurately maps to VSCode's TypeScript types:

| Our C Type | VSCode TS Type | Location | Match |
|------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| `CharRange` | `Range` | `src/vs/editor/common/core/range.ts` | ✓ Perfect |
| `LineRange` | `LineRange` | `src/vs/editor/common/core/ranges/lineRange.ts` | ✓ Perfect |
| `RangeMapping` | `RangeMapping` | `src/vs/editor/common/diff/rangeMapping.ts` | ✓ Perfect |
| `DetailedLineRangeMapping` | `DetailedLineRangeMapping` | `src/vs/editor/common/diff/rangeMapping.ts` | ✓ Perfect |
| `SequenceDiff` | Internal to Myers | `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/algorithms/myersDiffAlgorithm.ts` | ✓ Compatible |

**Key Observations:**
- VSCode uses **1-based line numbers** (same as us ✓)
- VSCode uses **1-based column numbers** (same as us ✓)
- `LineRange.endLineNumber` is **exclusive** (same as us ✓)
- `Range.endColumn` is **exclusive** (same as us ✓)

## Implementation Pipeline

Each step transforms input to output through the algorithm pipeline:

```
Input: lines_a[], lines_b[]
  ↓
[Step 1: Myers Algorithm] → SequenceDiffArray (line-level)
  ↓
[Step 2: Optimize Diffs] → SequenceDiffArray (optimized)
  ↓
[Step 3: Remove Short Matches] → SequenceDiffArray (cleaned)
  ↓
[Step 4: Refine to Chars] → RangeMappingArray (char-level)
  ↓
[Step 5: Build Line Mappings] → DetailedLineRangeMappingArray
  ↓
[Step 6: Detect Moves] → LinesDiff (with moves)
  ↓
[Final: Create Render Plan] → RenderPlan
```

## Step 1: Myers Diff Algorithm

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `const char** lines_a/b`, `int count_a/b` (original file content)
- **Output:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (line-level differences)

### What It Does
Computes the shortest edit sequence using Myers' O(ND) algorithm. Produces a minimal set of line-level differences representing insertions, deletions, and modifications.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/algorithms/myersDiffAlgorithm.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `MyersDiffAlgorithm.compute()`
  - `computeDiff()` - Core Myers implementation

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode has minimal tests for advanced diff (only 5 tests total in `defaultLinesDiffComputer.test.ts`, with just 1 basic Myers test). The following are our comprehensive test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Empty vs empty → no diffs
  2. Identical files → no diffs
  3. Single line insertion → 1 diff
  4. Single line deletion → 1 diff
  5. Single line modification → 1 diff (explicit modify test)
  6. Multiple separate diffs → correct diff array
  7. Interleaved changes → insert, delete, modify mixed
  8. Completely different files → 1 large diff
  9. Snake following verification → diagonal matching works
  10. Large file performance test (500+ lines)
  11. Worst-case scenario → maximum edit distance

---

## Step 2: Optimize Sequence Diffs

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (from Step 1), `const char** lines_a/b` (for context analysis)
- **Output:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (optimized - modified in-place)

### What It Does
Shifts diff boundaries to more intuitive positions (e.g., moving changes to blank lines or natural code boundaries). Joins adjacent diffs when beneficial for readability.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/algorithms/diffAlgorithm.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `optimizeSequenceDiffs()`
  - `shiftSequenceDiffs()` - Shift to better boundaries
  - `removeShortMatches()` - Preview of step 3

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Shift diff to blank line
  2. Shift diff to brace boundary
  3. Join adjacent diffs with 1-line gap
  4. Preserve meaningful separation
  5. Optimize at file start (boundary case)
  6. Optimize at file end (boundary case)
  7. No optimization needed (already optimal)
  8. Comment boundary shift

---

## Step 3: Remove Very Short Matches

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (from Step 2), `const char** lines_a/b` (for context), `int max_match_len`
- **Output:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (cleaned - modified in-place)

### What It Does
Merges diff regions separated by very short unchanged sequences (typically 1-2 lines). Improves visual coherence by treating closely related changes as single units.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/algorithms/diffAlgorithm.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `removeVeryShortMatchingLinesBetweenDiffs()`
  - `removeVeryShortMatchingTextBetweenDiffs()` - Character-level version

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Merge diffs with 1-line gap
  2. Keep diffs with 3+ line gap
  3. Edge case: start/end of file
  4. Multiple consecutive short matches
  5. Exactly 2-line gap (threshold boundary)
  6. All gaps are short (stress merge logic)
  7. Cascading merges (A+B, then (A+B)+C)
  8. Zero-line gap (adjacent diffs)

---

## Step 4: Refine to Character Level

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `SequenceDiffArray*` (from Step 3 - line-level), `const char** lines_a/b` (for text content)
- **Output:** `RangeMappingArray*` (character-level differences within changed lines)

### What It Does
For each line-level diff region, computes character-by-character differences using Myers algorithm again. This enables precise highlighting of changed text within lines.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/defaultLinesDiffComputer.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `computeMovedLines()` (contains refinement logic)
  - `MyersDiffAlgorithm.compute()` - Reused for character-level
  - Character sequence handling in `DiffAlgorithmResult`

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Single word change in line
  2. Multiple changes in one line
  3. Whitespace-only changes
  4. Empty line vs content line
  5. Full line replacement
  6. UTF-8 multibyte characters (e.g., "café" → "cafe")
  7. Emoji changes (e.g., "hello👋" → "hello")
  8. Tab vs spaces (e.g., "\t" vs "    ")
  9. Very long line (10k+ characters)
  10. Line ending changes (LF vs CRLF)

---

## Step 5: Build Line Range Mappings

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `RangeMappingArray*` (from Step 4 - char-level), `SequenceDiffArray*` (from Step 3 - line-level context)
- **Output:** `DetailedLineRangeMappingArray*` (line ranges with embedded char changes)

### What It Does
Groups character-level changes by line range. Creates `DetailedLineRangeMapping` objects that combine line-level regions with their inner character changes.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/rangeMapping.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `lineRangeMappingFromRangeMappings()`
  - `getLineRangeMapping()` - Single mapping conversion
  - `DetailedLineRangeMapping.fromRangeMappings()`

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Single-line change → 1 DetailedLineRangeMapping
  2. Multi-line change → 1 DetailedLineRangeMapping with multiple inner changes
  3. Adjacent line changes → Separate mappings
  4. Touching line changes → Single merged mapping
  5. Empty line in mapping
  6. Very large mapping (100+ lines)

---

## Step 6: Detect Moved Code (Optional)

### Input/Output
- **Input:** `DetailedLineRangeMappingArray*` (from Step 5), `const char** lines_a/b` (for content hashing)
- **Output:** `MovedTextArray*` (detected move operations)

### What It Does
Identifies code blocks that were moved (cut from one location, pasted in another). Helps distinguish moves from delete+insert pairs. This output is stored in `LinesDiff` alongside the changes but is **optional** for rendering.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/defaultLinesDiffComputer.ts`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `computeMovedLines()`
  - `computeMovedLineMappings()`
  - Hashing and matching logic for identical blocks

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Function moved to different location
  2. Multiple blocks moved
  3. Block moved and modified (should not detect)
  4. Partial move (only some lines)
  5. Hash collision handling
  6. Move within move (nested scenarios)
  7. Minimum block size threshold
  8. Identical duplicate blocks

---

## Final Step: Create Render Plan

### Input/Output
- **Input:** 
  - `LinesDiff*` (contains `DetailedLineRangeMappingArray` from Step 5, optionally `MovedTextArray` from Step 6)
  - `const char** lines_a/b`, `int count_a/b` (original text - needed to extract actual content for highlights)
- **Output:** `RenderPlan*` (UI-ready with text content + highlight positions)

### What It Does
Transforms coordinate-based algorithm output into rendering instructions with actual text content. Extracts character substrings using the coordinates from `DetailedLineRangeMappingArray` and creates line highlights, character highlights, and filler lines for alignment. Prepares separate left/right buffer metadata.

### VSCode Implementation Reference
- **Source:** `src/vs/browser/widget/diffEditor/*`
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Decoration types (line/char highlights)
  - Virtual/filler line insertion
  - Side-by-side alignment

### Unit Tests to Implement
- **Note:** VSCode doesn't have isolated tests for this step. The following are our test cases:
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Simple diff → correct highlights
  2. Multi-line change → proper alignment
  3. Move detection → move decorations
  4. Empty diff → no highlights
  5. Filler lines for alignment
  6. Very wide lines (wrapping behavior)
  7. Side-by-side alignment sync
  8. Mixed decoration types

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per Step)
Each module has isolated tests verifying correctness:
- Input/output validation
- Edge cases (empty, single-line, large files)
- Error handling (null input, invalid data)
- Memory safety (no leaks, proper cleanup)
- Performance bounds (time constraints)

### Integration Tests
- **Full Pipeline:** Feed real file diffs through entire pipeline
- **VSCode Comparison:** Compare our output against VSCode's expected results
- **Performance:** Benchmark against large files (1000+ lines)
- **Cross-Step:** Verify data flow between pipeline stages

### Additional Test Suites
**Error Handling:**
- Null/invalid input handling
- Negative counts
- Invalid UTF-8 sequences

**Memory Safety:**
- Memory leak detection (valgrind)
- Large allocation stress tests
- Proper cleanup verification

**Performance:**
- Each step < 50ms for typical files
- Large file benchmarks (500, 5000 lines)
- Worst-case complexity bounds

### Test Data Sources
1. **VSCode Advanced Tests:** `defaultLinesDiffComputer.test.ts` (5 tests - limited coverage)
2. **Real-World Files:** Common programming scenarios (refactoring, bug fixes)
3. **Synthetic Edge Cases:** Crafted for boundary conditions
4. **Adversarial Cases:** Worst-case complexity scenarios
