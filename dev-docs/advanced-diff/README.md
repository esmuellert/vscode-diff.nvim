# Advanced Diff Development Documentation

VSCode-parity advanced diff implementation logs.

## Documentation Files

**Implementation Plan**
- `VSCODE_ADVANCED_DIFF_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Overall architecture, all 4 steps

**Development Logs**
- `STEP1_CONSOLIDATED_DEVLOG.md` - Myers O(ND) algorithm journey (Oct 23-24)
- `STEP2_STEP3_CONSOLIDATED_DEVLOG.md` - Optimization algorithms journey (Oct 24)

## Reading Order

1. `VSCODE_ADVANCED_DIFF_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Understand overall architecture
2. `STEP1_CONSOLIDATED_DEVLOG.md` - Myers algorithm: 5 phases from prototype to parity
