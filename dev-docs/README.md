# Development Documentation

**Created**: 2024-10-22 18:45:00 UTC

This folder contains development documentation for the vscode-diff.nvim project.

## Documents

### 1. [VSCODE_PARITY_ASSESSMENT.md](./VSCODE_PARITY_ASSESSMENT.md)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive assessment of parity with VSCode's diff editor  
**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Rendering mechanism is at full parity
- ⚠️ Diff algorithm uses LCS instead of Myers (functionally equivalent)
- ✅ Visual presentation matches VSCode
- ✅ Filler lines working correctly

### 2. [FILLER_LINE_FIX.md](./FILLER_LINE_FIX.md)
**Purpose**: Documentation of the filler line bug fix  
**Key Changes**:
- Replaced naive line-by-line diff with LCS-based algorithm
- Added verbose mode for debugging
- Fixed INSERT vs MODIFY detection

### 3. [AUDIT_REPORT.md](./AUDIT_REPORT.md)
**Purpose**: Section-by-section audit of implementation vs spec  
**Status**: Implementation audit checklist

### 4. [DEVELOPMENT_DIARY.md](./DEVELOPMENT_DIARY.md)
**Purpose**: Development log and decisions  
**Contents**: Historical development notes

## Quick Reference

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with verbose mode
nvim --headless -c "luafile tests/e2e_test.lua" -- -v
nvim --headless -c "luafile tests/test_filler.lua" -- -v
```

### Key Files
- **C Core**: `../c-diff-core/diff_core.c`
- **Lua Renderer**: `../lua/vscode-diff/init.lua`
- **Implementation Spec**: `../VSCODE_DIFF_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Status Summary

**MVP Status**: ✅ **Complete and Working**

**Core Features**:
- ✅ Line-level diff (LCS algorithm)
- ✅ Character-level diff (Myers algorithm)
- ✅ Filler line generation
- ✅ Two-level highlighting
- ✅ Side-by-side layout

**Known Gaps**:
- ⚠️ Synchronized scrolling (not implemented)
- ❌ Move detection (not in MVP scope)
- ⚠️ Uses LCS vs Myers for line diff (functionally equivalent)
