# Header Include Refactoring (2024-11-01)

## Summary

Removed the `../include/` anti-pattern from 21 C source files to follow industry standards.
CMake already configured include paths via `target_include_directories`, making relative paths unnecessary.

## Changes Made

**Before:**
```c
#include "../include/myers.h"
```

**After:**
```c
#include "myers.h"
```

**Files Modified:** 21 total
- 11 source files in `libvscode-diff/src/`
- 10 test files in `libvscode-diff/tests/`

## Why This Change?

1. **Industry Standard**: All major C projects (Linux, SQLite, Redis, libuv, LLVM) use CMake-managed include paths
2. **Better IDE Support**: Improves IntelliSense and code navigation
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removes coupling between source files and directory structure
4. **Already Configured**: CMake was correctly set up; source files just needed to match

## Testing Results

✅ **Build**: Clean compilation (no errors/warnings)
✅ **C Unit Tests**: 4 passing (same as before)
✅ **Diff Comparison**: 227 tests completed successfully
✅ **No Regression**: All functionality preserved

## Technical Details

The `../include/` pattern was unnecessary because `CMakeLists.txt` already configures:

```cmake
target_include_directories(vscode_diff
    PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
)
```

This allows source files to use simple includes like `#include "header.h"` while the build system
manages the actual include paths. This is the standard approach for modern C projects.

## Benefits

- Follows industry best practices
- Better IDE integration (IntelliSense, go-to-definition)
- More maintainable and flexible codebase
- Easier to reorganize code structure if needed
