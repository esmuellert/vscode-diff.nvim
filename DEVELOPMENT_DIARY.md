# Development Diary - vscode-diff.nvim

**Project**: VSCode-style diff rendering for Neovim  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: MVP Complete ✅

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Data Structure Design (Following VSCode)

**Source of Truth**: `microsoft/vscode/src/vs/editor/common/diff/rangeMapping.ts`

VSCode uses a hierarchical structure:
- `LineRangeMapping`: Maps line ranges between original and modified
- `DetailedLineRangeMapping`: Extends above with `innerChanges` (character-level diffs)
- `RangeMapping`: Character-level range mapping

**Our C Implementation**:
```c
typedef struct {
    LineRange original;
    LineRange modified;
    RangeMapping* innerChanges;
} DetailedLineRangeMapping;
```

This matches VSCode's design exactly, ensuring compatibility with their proven approach.

### 2. Highlight Groups (The "Deeper Color" Effect)

**Source of Truth**: 
- `src/vs/editor/browser/widget/diffEditor/registrations.contribution.ts`
- `src/vs/editor/browser/widget/diffEditor/style.css`

**Critical Finding**: VSCode uses exactly 4 highlight types (not 5):
1. `line-insert` - Light green background (entire line)
2. `line-delete` - Light red background (entire line)
3. `char-insert` - Deep/dark green (changed characters only) ← THE "DEEPER COLOR"
4. `char-delete` - Deep/dark red (changed characters only) ← THE "DEEPER COLOR"

**NO BLUE HIGHLIGHTS** in VSCode's diff view.

The "deeper color" effect is achieved by:
- Light background on entire modified line (e.g., `#1e3a1e` for inserts)
- Darker background on changed characters (e.g., `#2d6d2d` for char inserts)

This two-tier system is THE defining feature that makes VSCode's diff superior.

### 3. Diff Algorithm: Modification vs. Delete+Insert

**Problem Encountered**: Initial algorithm treated line modifications as separate delete and insert operations, causing misalignment.

**Example**:
```
Original: ["line1", "line2", "line3"]
Modified: ["line1", "line2_modified", "line3"]
```

**Wrong approach**:
- Delete "line2" → add filler on right
- Insert "line2_modified" → add filler on left
- Result: 4 lines instead of 3

**Correct approach**:
- Introduce `MODIFY` operation type (type=3)
- When lines at same position differ: treat as modification, not delete+insert
- Result: Lines stay aligned, both sides have content with character-level diff

**Code**:
```c
else if (i < count_a && j < count_b) {
    // Both have content but lines don't match - this is a modification
    ops[*op_count] = (DiffOp){
        .type = 3,  // modify
        .orig_start = i,
        .orig_len = 1,
        .mod_start = j,
        .mod_len = 1
    };
}
```

### 4. Lua FFI String Handling

**Issue**: Passing Lua strings to C via FFI requires careful pointer management.

**Solution**:
```lua
local function lua_to_c_strings(tbl)
  local count = #tbl
  local arr = ffi.new("const char*[?]", count)
  for i, str in ipairs(tbl) do
    arr[i - 1] = str  -- FFI keeps strings alive
  end
  return arr, count
end
```

The FFI automatically manages string lifetime when assigned to `const char*` array.

### 5. Neovim Virtual Lines API

**Issue**: `nvim_buf_set_extmark` with `virt_lines` parameter.

**Wrong**:
```lua
virt_lines = {{"text", "Normal"}}  -- Error: expected Array
```

**Correct**:
```lua
virt_lines = {{{"text", "Normal"}}}  -- Array of lines, each line is array of chunks
```

Each virtual line is an array of text chunks with highlight groups.

### 6. Highlight Color Format

**Issue**: Neovim doesn't support 8-digit hex colors with alpha channel directly.

**Wrong**:
```lua
bg = "#9bb95533"  -- Error: Invalid highlight color
```

**Correct**:
```lua
bg = "#1e3a1e"  -- 6-digit RGB only
```

Use color blending math to approximate alpha-blended colors on common backgrounds.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. C Unit Tests
- Test core diff algorithm
- Verify data structure correctness
- Memory leak checks (all malloc/free pairs verified)

### 2. Lua Unit Tests
- FFI binding correctness
- Type conversion accuracy
- API contract validation

### 3. E2E Tests
- Full plugin loading
- Command execution
- Buffer creation and rendering
- Highlight application

## Performance Considerations

### Current Status (MVP)
- **Simple line-by-line diff**: O(n*m) worst case
- **Character diff**: Highlights entire line for modifications (O(1) per line)
- **Good for**: Files up to ~1000 lines

### Future Optimizations
1. **Implement full Myers algorithm**: O(ND) where D is edit distance
2. **Advanced character-level LCS**: Precise character highlighting
3. **Skip unchanged regions**: Don't process large identical blocks
4. **Incremental updates**: Only recompute changed portions

## VSCode Source Code Learnings

### Key Files Studied
1. `src/vs/editor/common/diff/algorithms/myersDiffAlgorithm.ts`
   - Efficient diff algorithm implementation
   - Edit graph traversal

2. `src/vs/editor/common/diff/standardLinesDiffComputer.ts`
   - Line-level diff computation
   - Ignore whitespace options

3. `src/vs/editor/browser/widget/diffEditor/components/diffEditorDecorations.ts`
   - Decoration application
   - Virtual line zones for alignment

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of concerns**: Diff computation (model) vs. rendering (view)
- **Immutable data structures**: Diff results are read-only
- **Lazy evaluation**: Only compute character diffs for visible regions (future)

## Remaining TODOs for Production

### Critical
- [ ] Full Myers diff algorithm (current is simplified)
- [ ] Proper character-level LCS (current highlights entire line)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty files, binary files)

### Important
- [ ] Syntax highlighting preservation
- [ ] Large file optimization
- [ ] Memory profiling

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Live diff updates
- [ ] Inline diff mode
- [ ] Git integration
- [ ] Custom themes
